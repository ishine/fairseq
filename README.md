This repo contains the **official** code and pre-trained models for the following papers:

- [Dual-decoder Transformer for Joint Automatic Speech Recognition and Multilingual Speech Translation](examples/speech_text_dual_decoder/README.md) (**COLING 2020, Oral**)
- [Lightweight Adapter Tuning for Multilingual Speech Translation](https://github.com/formiel/fairseq/blob/995be2b9da333c6d2ae75fab0714d94728ba0ae6/examples/speech_to_text/docs/adapters.md) (**ACL 2021**)
- [Pre-training for Speech Translation: CTC Meets Optimal Transport](examples/speech_text_siamese) (**ICML 2023, Oral**)

This is a fork of `fairseq` and I will try to keep it up-to-date with the latest features from their `main` branch.
